## Terminology  
  
Unfortunately, generating JSON goes by a few different names that roughly mean the same thing:  
  
* Structured Outputs: Using an LLM to generate any structured output including JSON, XML, or YAML regardless of technique (e.g. function calling, guided generation).
* [Function Calling](https://www.promptingguide.ai/applications/function_calling): Providing an LLM a hypothetical (or actual) function definition for it to "call" in it's chat or completion response. The LLM doesn't actually call the function, it just provides an indication that one should be called via a JSON message.
* [JSON Mode](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/json-mode): Specifying that an LLM must generate valid JSON. Depending on the provider, a schema may or may not be specified and the LLM may create an unexpected schema.
* [Tool Usage](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/openai_tools): Giving an LLM a choice of tools such as image generation, web search, and "function calling".  The functional calling parameter in the API request is now called "tools".
* [Guided Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09702): For constraining an LLM model to generate text that follows a prescribed specification such as a [Context-Free Grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar).
* [GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/introduction): ChatGPT invokes actions (i.e. API calls) based on the endpoints and parameters specified in an [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/specification/). Unlike the capability called "Function Calling", this capability will indeed call your function hosted by an API server.

None of these names are great, that's why I named this list just "Awesome LLM JSON".
  
## Hosted Models

This is a list of known Hosted API providers that support Function Calling in alphabetical order.

JSON mode enables users to define a JSON output schema for the model to follow, while grammar mode allows for describing the desired context-free grammar in an extended BNF form. 

[Function Calling in Ollama vs OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXDWkiuXtG0) (2024-02-13, [Matt Williams](https://twitter.com/Technovangelist)) compares the implementation of function calling in Ollama and OpenAI models. It clarifies that function calling is a misnomer, as the model itself does not call functions but rather generates output in a structured format like JSON, which the calling program can then parse to invoke functions. The video demonstrates how to achieve this using Python with both APIs, highlighting Ollama's simpler approach using the `format_json` parameter and a JSON schema. It also touches on using few-shot prompts to improve consistency in the model's responses.

[LLM Engineering: Structured Outputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xUeL63ymM0) (2024-02-12, [Jason Liu](https://twitter.com/jxnlco), [Weights & Biases Course](https://www.wandb.courses/)) Author of the Instructor library, offers a concise course on handling structured JSON output, function calling, and complex validations using Pydantic. This course covers the essentials of extracting and validating structured data from LLMs, making machine learning pipelines more robust and reliable, and integrating complex models and pipelines into production environments efficiently.

[Why Pydantic became indispensable for LLMs](https://www.factsmachine.ai/p/how-pydantic-became-indispensable) (2024-01-19, [Adam Azzam](https://twitter.com/aaazzam)) explains how the Pydantic data validation library has emerged as a critical tool for working with LLMs. Pydantic enables sharing data models via standardized JSON schemas, which LLMs have been trained on extensively. This allows LLMs to reason between unstructured and structured data effectively. The article highlights the importance of quantizing the decision space for LLMs by using standards like JSON schemas that they understand well. However, it also notes potential issues due to LLMs being overfit to older JSON schema versions.

[Pydantic is all you need](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj-wSRJwrrc) (2023-10-10, [Jason Liu](https://twitter.com/jxnlco), [AI Engineer Conference](https://www.ai.engineer/)) discusses the importance of using Pydantic for structured prompting and output validation when working with large language models (LLMs). The talk introduces the Instructor library, which integrates Pydantic with OpenAI's function calling, enabling type-safe and modular prompts. Liu also showcases advanced applications like building knowledge graphs, query planning, and fact extraction, demonstrating how structured prompting can lead to more reliable and maintainable LLM-powered applications.
